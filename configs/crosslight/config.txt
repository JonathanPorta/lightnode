Global configuration of lighttpd is in lighttpd.conf including hostname, port,
doc-root, pid-file, and included extensions. lighttpd.conf starts by calling 
lighttpd.conf.local, which is automatically generated and should only have a
single directive specifying the root directory to use. (In the future, we might
use this to chroot the app.)

lighttpd.mimetype.conf is so that I don't pollute the main config file with all
the mimetype decls. lighttpd.fastcgi.conf is to configure FastCGI and CHI opts.
lighttpd.rewrite.conf is for any rewrite rules (currently for CodeIgniter).
lighttpd.ssl.conf is for ssl engine configuration, but is not enabled by default.
Use ./etc/configssl.sh to generate keys and enable ssl. ./etc/lighttpd.debug.conf
has some nice options for debugging mod_rewrite and others, but is disabled by
default.
